# Snow Atlas Cloud Visibility API

# Requirements
    SKU SO-CLD-H

Snow Atlas is a cloud-native technology intelligence platform providing Snow products as SaaS solutions.
## Description
Cloud on Snow Atlas provides insight into your organizationâ€™s multi-cloud environment. The beta version of Cloud offers visibility into your Azure and AWS public cloud consumption. The cloud connectors you set up in Snow Atlas retrieve data from Azure and AWS. That data is transferred to Snow Atlas and shown in a single chart view on Cloud visibility, giving you a complete overview of your organization's cloud resources and spending.

Add cloud connectors to collect data on your cloud consumption. You must be a SAM System Administrator to do this. For more information on cloud connectors, see Cloud connectors.
Learn how to manage views of data in Cloud on Snow Atlas. For more information, see Manage views.
Learn about beta features and upcoming enhancements to Cloud on Snow Atlas. 
## API Requirements
To properly use the cloud visibility dashboard you must be licensed, this can be verified in **Snow Atlas Settings** on the **License Details page**. There you will see the Cloud Visibility line item with the SKU **SO-CLD-H**, if not please contact sales for a trial.
