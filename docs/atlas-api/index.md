# Snow Atlas Developer Resources

## What's New

### Containers

Container Visibility provides you with insight into your containerized environment. The container connectors installed in your clusters collect data that is transferred to Snow Atlas, which uses the data to identify the containers in your clusters and the applications running in the containers. With this data, you gain an overview of your containerized datacenters and information on the software running in them to give you visibility into your organization's use of containers.

### Cloud Visibility

Snow Atlas provides insight into your organizationâ€™s multi-cloud environment. The beta version of Cloud offers visibility into your Azure and AWS cloud usage. The cloud connectors you set up in Snow Atlas retrieve data from Azure and AWS, and transfer that data to the Cloud application. Your data is shown in a single chart view on Cloud visibility, giving you a full overview of your organization's cloud resources and costs.
