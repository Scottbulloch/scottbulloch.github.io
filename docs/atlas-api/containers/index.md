# Snow Atlas Containers API

Container Visibility provides you with insight into your containerized environment. The container connectors installed in your clusters collect data that is transferred to Snow Atlas, which uses the data to identify the containers in your clusters and the applications running in the containers. With this data, you gain an overview of your containerized datacenters and information on the software running in them to give you visibility into your organization's use of containers.

## To get started with Container Visibility:

Set up container connectors to collect data from your clusters. For more information on container connectors, see Container connectors.
Learn about the overview that you gain of your containerized environment from the data collected. For more information, see Containers overview.

## API Requirements
To properly use the cloud visibility dashboard you must be licensed, this can be verified in **Snow Atlas Settings** on the **License Details page**. There you will see the Containers Visibility line item with the SKU **AT-C-H-OTSL**, if not please contact sales for a trial.
